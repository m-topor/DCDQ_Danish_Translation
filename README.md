#### The preprint associated with the data and analyses can be found here: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pcmfv 

## General information
The current repository stores anonymised data and analysis code for the research project linked above. In the project, we translated and adapted the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire into Danish. We also did a validity and reliability check.    

## Contents
**The data** - In the folder *"Raw Data"* each participant included in the analyses has their own folder. In the folder, there are separate files with data recorded for each measure. The file *"participants.csv"* includes general information about the grouping of the participants as well as any comments on data collection. The *"data_output.csv"* file contains the final dataset produced by the script *"Data_analyses.R"*. The *"meta_XXX.txt"* files contain metadata.  

**Project materials** - Project materials include all translated versions of the questionnaire alongside the notes received from the translators. There is a folder for pre-final versions of the translated DCDQ. These versions were used in the current study, and since no changes were made following the completion of the study, these versions are exactly the same as the final version of the questionnaire included in the manuscript. The difference between the two pre-final versions is that the *"..._space_for_parent_feedback"* version has empty spaces for parents to give feedback on the questionnaire items. The *"..._with_scoring"* file has scoring instructions for future users of the questionnaire, also translated into Danish. The final version of the questionnaire is included in the article appendix but it can also be downloaded here as a standalone word file - *"DCDQ_final_with_scoring.docx"*.
